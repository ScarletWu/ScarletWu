👋 Hi, I’m @ScarletWu

👀 I’m interested in integrating my physiology education with my technical skills in data analysis. I am committed to contributing to interdisciplinary studies and public health. My journey has taken me through various labs and research projects, from investigating liver ischemic injury at Unity Health to developing software for diabetes prevention with the PREVENT Project. These experiences have not only honed my lab and analytical skills but also fueled my passion for merging biological insights with data-driven solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced analysis methods. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to solve complex health challenges through innovative data analysis and technology applications. Whether it's developing predictive models for disease prevention or leveraging AI to understand biological processes better, I'm here to make a difference.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me through email at scarletruoxianwu@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, potential collaborations, or simply connecting with like-minded individuals in the field.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: Beyond the lab and code, I find harmony in music as a cellist. This creative outlet not only enriches my life but also reminds me of the beauty in collaboration and the symphony of bringing diverse elements together – much like in interdisciplinary research.
